# WebSocket Client Redesign

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Current Architecture

The current WebSocket client (`WebSocketInnerClient`) has several components:

1. **Core Structure**: Single client with basic reconnection logic
2. **Message Handling**: Simple message processing with basic validation
3. **Connection Management**: Basic connection with limited fallback
4. **Event System**: Callback-based system with limited flexibility

### Current Limitations

1. **Reliability**: Basic reconnection without sophisticated retry logic
2. **Performance**: No message batching or optimization
3. **Event Handling**: Limited event system without proper handlers
4. **Connection**: Single connection attempt without proper failover
5. **Resource Management**: No connection pooling or rate limiting

## PocketOption Async Implementation Analysis

### Key Features from PocketOption Implementation

1. **Connection Management** (`websocket_client.py`):

   - Connection pooling with statistics tracking
   - Message batching for performance
   - Rate limiting with semaphores
   - SSL context configuration
   - Multiple region support with fallback

2. **Client Architecture** (`client.py`):

   - Persistent connections with keep-alive
   - Event-driven architecture with callbacks
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Health monitoring and statistics
   - Multiple connection types (regular vs persistent)

3. **Message Processing**:
   - Optimized message routing with handlers
   - Message caching with TTL
   - Fast message routing with prefix matching
   - Background task management

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Connection Management

```rust
pub struct ConnectionPool {
    active_connections: HashMap<String, ConnectionInfo>,
    connection_stats: HashMap<String, ConnectionStats>,
    max_connections: usize,
}

pub struct ConnectionStats {
    response_times: VecDeque<Duration>,
    successes: u64,
    failures: u64,
    avg_response_time: Duration,
    success_rate: f64,
}
```

### 2. Message Batching System

```rust
pub struct MessageBatcher {
    batch_size: usize,
    batch_timeout: Duration,
    pending_messages: VecDeque<Message>,
    last_batch_time: Instant,
}
```

### 3. Event Handler System

```rust
pub trait EventHandler: Send + Sync {
    async fn handle_event(&self, event: Event) -> BinaryOptionsResult<()>;
}

pub struct EventManager {
    handlers: HashMap<EventType, Vec<Arc<dyn EventHandler>>>,
    event_queue: async_channel::Sender<Event>,
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Reconnection Strategy

```rust
pub struct ReconnectionManager {
    max_attempts: u32,
    current_attempts: u32,
    backoff_strategy: BackoffStrategy,
    health_checker: HealthChecker,
}

pub enum BackoffStrategy {
    Linear(Duration),
    Exponential { base: Duration, max: Duration },
    Custom(Box<dyn Fn(u32) -> Duration + Send + Sync>),
}
```

### 5. Health Monitoring

```rust
pub struct HealthMonitor {
    last_ping: Instant,
    ping_interval: Duration,
    connection_health: ConnectionHealth,
    stats: ConnectionStats,
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Implement connection pooling
2. Add message batching
3. Create event handler system
4. Implement health monitoring

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

1. Advanced reconnection strategies
2. Rate limiting and flow control
3. Message caching and optimization
4. Background task management

### Phase 3: Integration

1. Update existing traits and implementations
2. Migrate PocketOption client to new system
3. Add configuration options
4. Performance testing and optimization

## Configuration Improvements

Based on PocketOption's constants, we need:

```rust
pub struct WebSocketConfig {
    // Connection settings
    ping_interval: Duration,
    ping_timeout: Duration,
    close_timeout: Duration,
    max_reconnect_attempts: u32,
    reconnect_delay: Duration,
    message_timeout: Duration,

    // Performance settings
    batch_size: usize,
    batch_timeout: Duration,
    max_concurrent_operations: usize,
    cache_ttl: Duration,

    // SSL and headers
    ssl_verify: bool,
    custom_headers: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

## Migration Strategy

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Keep existing APIs while adding new features
2. **Gradual Migration**: Phase-based implementation
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with existing PocketOption implementation
4. **Documentation**: Update all documentation and examples

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Better connection management and reconnection
2. **Enhanced Performance**: Message batching and caching
3. **Better Resource Management**: Connection pooling and rate limiting
4. **Flexibility**: Event-driven architecture with custom handlers
5. **Monitoring**: Built-in health monitoring and statistics
